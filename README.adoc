== My personnal bookmarklet collection

A collection of bookmarklets I use.

Except mentionned otherwise, those were created by me.
When I find a free (as in freedom) bookmarklet useful, I'll make sure to provide proper credit and licensing information.

== Installing bookmarklets from this collection

WARNING: *DO NOT* install those bookmarklets if you don't fully understand how they work. +
Javascript code will be running on your machine when using those bookmarklets (or others) and *could* have access to sensitive information. +
Of course, I do use/code those bookmarklets.
I do not send sensitive informations with those. +
Stillâ€¦ You shouldn't run code written by a single hacker blindly. +
This is a general advise.
